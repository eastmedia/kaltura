Kaltura API
======================

An ActiveResource-like RESTful interface to the Kaltura API

You can copy the templates/kaltura.yml.template file into your Rails app as config/kaltura.yml.
Replace the values with your own partner info that you received from Kaltura.

Specs are to test the Kaltura API directly, not this library itself.

Pre-requisites
======================

* ActiveSupport
* ActiveResource

Please note that there is a small bug in ActiveResource, where it will not return the response data if the response contains unescaped %'s.  See patches/patch_for_activeresource_connection.rb for the fix.
